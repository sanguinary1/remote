1. Data to transmit is passed to the command-line: AudioTransmit_Send.exe "A test string"
2. The program creates a blank temporary .wav file.
3. A sine-wave is generated in a specific frequency to indicate the start of a new data transmission. This tone is appended to the wave file.
4. Each data byte is converted into bits - an "on" or "off" tone is generated for each bit. A separate confirmation tone is sent after each bit value.
5. A final tone is appended to indicate the end of the transmission.
6. The temporary wave file is played through the computer speakers and then deleted.
